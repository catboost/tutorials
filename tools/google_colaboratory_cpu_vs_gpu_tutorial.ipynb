    "# Gradient Boosting: CPU vs GPU\n",
    "This is a basic tuturoal which shows how to run gradient boosting on CPU and GPU on Google Colaboratory. It will give you an opportunity to see the speedup that you get from GPU training. The speedup is large even on Tesla K80 that is available in Colaboratory. On newer generations of GPU the speedup will be much bigger.\n",

    "We will use CatBoost gradient boosting library, which is known for it's good GPU performance.\n",
